## 🧩 Overview  

MacCleaner is a comprehensive system optimization solution designed to keep macOS running smoothly and efficiently. It provides a full toolkit for cleaning, organizing, and maintaining your Mac, removing unnecessary files, monitoring system performance, and freeing up valuable storage space.  

This utility goes beyond basic cleaning — it analyzes the entire system structure to locate hidden junk files, browser caches, system logs, and unused language packs. By removing these safely, MacCleaner helps improve startup speed, reduce lag, and maintain optimal performance without affecting your essential files or apps.  

The software includes real-time monitoring tools that track CPU, RAM, and disk usage, allowing you to identify resource-heavy processes instantly. You can schedule automatic cleanups, reclaim gigabytes of wasted space, and extend your device’s lifespan through regular optimization routines.  

MacCleaner also features smart modules for memory management, app uninstallation, duplicate file detection, and large file cleanup. It’s built with macOS design principles in mind — offering a simple, elegant interface that’s both intuitive for beginners and powerful enough for professionals who demand system stability and performance precision.  

Unlike many one-click cleaners, MacCleaner gives you full control over what to remove and what to keep. Detailed statistics, visual storage maps, and customizable cleaning presets ensure your system remains organized, responsive, and clutter-free. Whether you’re using an older Mac or the latest Apple Silicon device, MacCleaner adapts to your hardware for maximum optimization.
